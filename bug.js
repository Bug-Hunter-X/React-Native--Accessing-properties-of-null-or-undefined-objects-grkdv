This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations where data might not be available immediately.

Example:
```javascript
//Incorrect way
this.state.user.name; // Throws error if this.state.user is null or undefined

//Correct Way
this.state.user?.name || 'Guest'; // Uses optional chaining and nullish coalescing
```

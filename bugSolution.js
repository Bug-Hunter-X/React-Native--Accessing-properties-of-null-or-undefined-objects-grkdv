The solution involves using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`).

Optional chaining allows you to safely access nested properties without causing an error if any intermediate property is null or undefined.

Nullish coalescing provides a fallback value if the property is null or undefined.

```javascript
// Safe way to access nested properties
const userName = this.state.user?.name ?? 'Guest';

//Explanation:
//this.state.user?.name attempts to access name from this.state.user. If this.state.user is null or undefined the expression short-circuits and returns undefined. 
//If the expression returns undefined then ?? 'Guest' returns the default value of 'Guest'.

//Another Example:
const address = this.state.user?.address?.street ?? 'N/A';
```
This approach prevents crashes and provides a user-friendly experience by offering a default value when data is not yet available.
